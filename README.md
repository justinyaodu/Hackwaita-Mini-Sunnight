# Hackwaita-Mini-Sunnight

A fork of [Hackwaita-Mini](https://github.com/justinyaodu/Hackwaita-Mini) with the following changes from Adwaita:

* Compact button and widget styles
* No animations (CSS `transition: none`)
* Window styles don't change when a window loses focus
* Sunnight (dark) color scheme
* Remove window borders to improve appearance on tiling WMs
